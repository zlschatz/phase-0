<h3>What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?</h3>

<p>The primary goal of my site is to serve as a personal website. The site will share personal background as well as content about my experience as a web developer. This will include blog posts and projects. There will also be a section for contact information. </p>

<h3>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?</h3>

<p>I see the target audience being people interested in learning more about my professional career. The primary interst is to learn more information about me. The site will clearly layout all information needed by a prospective employer. </p>

<h3>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.</h3>

<p>The primary action will be to review a portfolio of projects. This will be the focal point of the site as it's intended to share my experiences. The secondary action will be to contact me through the website.</p>

<h3>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</h3>

<p>A few main things to know... Planning ahead is very important before diving into any code. Also, the design and user experience should be catered to the target audience that will be engaging with the site.</p>

<h3>What is user experience design and why is it valuable?</h3>

<p>User experience design is the principle of improving the user experience through interactions with a given website. This will improve the relationship a user develops with the website through usability, accessibility and enjoyment. This is valuable as poor user experience design will lead to less web traffic.
I think of this like choosing an outfit for the day. It will make a better first impression on others if you don't look like you just rolled out of bed for a meeting. Personally, when I visit a website that is difficult to navigate and does not function well, I tend to avoid revisiting in the future.</p>

<h3>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h3>

<p>For some reason I've had issues with displaying the image. Additionally -- I wouldn't necessarily call this tedious -- but there is such a vast amount of research pertaining to design that's available with a quick search. As I begin to learn more about design, it's difficult to tell who's writing opinions and who's writing best practices.</p>
