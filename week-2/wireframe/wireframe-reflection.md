<h2>Reflection Answers</h2>

<h3>What is a wireframe?</h3>
<p>A wireframe is a drawn out plan of a website displaying a preliminary layout. It can range in complexity, from a basic sketch to a colorful mock-up. </p>

<h3>What are the benefits of wireframing?</h3>
<p>There are numerous benefits to wireframing. One of these benefits is thinking ahead before coding to not delay the building process. It can become very complex to think through creative ideas while executing code. Best practice may be to wireframe and make decisions before coding, then begin building out the sketched design. Wireframing also lays out the components of the website to be included. It can help answer questions such as: What content will be included? Where will the navigation bar be found? Is there information to provide in the footer? What will the relationship between text and imagery look like? It is very beneficial to answer these questions prior to building a site.</p>

<h3>Did you enjoy wireframing your site?</h3>
<p>I do like wireframing! I enjoy sketching websites and trying new designs -- although, the options can seem endless as I run around in circles. I'm definitely not creative expert, but I like to try multiple versions before choosing a specific layout.</p>

<h3>Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?</h3>
<p>I revised it a couple times, but then realized that I could go on all day with my wireframe. I time boxed my wireframing to 20 minutes before moving on. I know I can always go back with new ideas, but I felt as though the purpose of this module was to familiarize with the process rather than dwell on ideas. </p>

<h3>What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</h3>
<p>My first question was, "what's a good design for personal websites?" I then began searching through blog posts such as "40 Brilliant Personal Websites" and "Top 20 Creative Portfolio Sites." The options are endless.</p>

<h3>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?</h3>
<p>I enjoyed sketching because it's similar to building. You make something from the ground up and put ideas to paper. I also like looking through other people's creative websites to gain inspiration for my own.
I am still struggling with the markdown language images and hope to solve that issue ASAP.</p>
