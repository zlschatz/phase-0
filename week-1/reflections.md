#1.1 Thank About Time Reflection#
From the suggested material, I decided to dive into the Pomodoro Technique and the principle of developing habits. I found the Pomodoro Technique interesting by breaking up work on a time basis, rather than a task basis. Currently, I find myself writing out lists of "to-do's" and taking short breaks after completing a given task. The Pomodoro technique encourages breaks by 25 minute intervals, to create steady flow of work progression. I think this ties in nicely to the concept of creating habits to build consistency, as the habit could be that you don't stop working until the timer rings. Creating this flow of an hour focus with two 5-minute breaks (25 work, 5 break, 25 work, 5 break) seems like something that would be beneficial while coding.

Time boxing was another concept mentioned in the articles that seems relatively intuitive, but interesting to read about as a time management tactic. Generally speaking, time boxing is a designated time interval set by a group until checking in with one another for a work update. I believe this tactic will be used during Phase 0 as a check in with teachers and fellow students to make sure everyone is progressing at the appropriate speed. It's also a good way to hold yourself to schedule -- if a new module is due every week, we know that there is a deadline and can map out how to best manage our own time to complete the objective. My schedule may be different from another person's, but we both have the same goal to complete the task within the given time box.

As I briefly mentioned before, I currently manage time by writing out lists of tasks to accomplish on a daily and weekly basis. I also tend to rank in order of priority and length. I feel it is good to mix short tasks with longer ones, as to not spend too many consecutive hours chipping away at big assignments. I feel as though my strategy works, but it can be difficult to build a good flow throughout the day. Sometimes I would rather spend time reading blog posts rather than completing a research assignment. Building a flow and motivating with small rewards -- such as setting aside a good article to read after a task is completed -- could be a beneficial strategy moving forward.

My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to dedicate time each night to focus on completing tasks. I know that working a full-time job will be difficult to balance, but if I build a habit of sitting down for a couple of hours each night, it will make the process run much smoother. I realize that my free time on the weekends will largely be spent completing additional work, but I cannot rely solely on that time. I plan to test out methods such as the pomodoro method and time boxing to build habits and manage my time more efficiently.

I also would like to try out 5 minutes of meditation each night to clear my head before digging into Phase 0 work each night.

#1.2 The Command LIne Reflection#
A shell is a program that allows developers to input commands and actions for an operating system to perform. It is the basic user interface to allow programmers to interact with the operating system as well. When we open terminal, we are accessing shell to give commands. Learning how to work with a shell will help us learn more complex languages in the future.

Similarly, Bash is another version of a shell, with a variety of capabilities and plugins that shell does not have. It is a specific type of Unix shell. Bash is slightly more advanced, but maintains the fundamental commands of shell. It brings together features from various shell programs.

The most challenging part of going through the material was the density of the available commands. It can be a bit overwhelming to see the many different commands, and try to grasp them all at once. I think the key will be continuous repetition and acknowledging that I will learn to master the commands over time. Although the video and step by step crash course are helpful, it'll be nice to talk it through in person.

I was not able to successfully use all the commands. At various times I would input a given command and receive warnings such as "file does not exist." I would go back and retrace my steps but similar issues would reoccur. I think I just need to take a step back and retry working through the Crash Course.

In my opinion, the most important commands would be ones to create, remove and search through directories. That may be broad (and cover a lot of the commands), but these are all key for problem solving scenarios. It also seems as though navigating through the command line interface is a basis of communication for developers - something that everyone understands, no matter what their expertise may be.

Off the top of my head:

-pwd --> print working directory

-ls --> list directory

-mv

-cd --> change directory

-../

-touch

-mkdir --> make directory

-less --> show page of text

-rmdir --> remove directory

-rm --> remove

-help --> help?

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection#
Instructions to create new repo:

1 - Login to your Github profile

2 - Open the drop-down menu from the "+" icon in the top-right-corner

3 - Select "New Repository"

4 - Name the repository and complete additional information as needed

5 - Select "Create Repository"



Instructions to fork a repo:

1 - Open the repo

2 - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner

3 - Pop-up prompt will ask where you would like to fork from. Select your profile name.



Instructions to clone a repo:

1 - Open rep that you'd like to clone in Github

2 - Copy the "HTTPS Clone URL" from the righthand side

3 - Open program to access command line (i.e. terminal)

4 - Type in the following command "git clone" followed by the pasted URL.

Command example: "git clone [PASTED URL HERE]"



Creating a new repository generates an empty workspace, while forking a repository creates a copy of the given code, allowing someone to make changes without affecting the master copy. The forked copy will be sent directly to your account. You would fork to make additions, edits or build upon a repo.



While setting up git and Github, I forgot a couple of the commands to be used in terminal. Through this, I was able to practice adding and removing directories. I also learned that directories cannot be removed using the "rm" command, but rather the "rm -rf" command.
