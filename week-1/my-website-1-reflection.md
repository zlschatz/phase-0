#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.#
Creating a repository and a clone repository involve working in both the Github environment as well as the command line interface. First, login to Github and navigate to your profile. Next, select "new repository," and begin naming/labeling the new repository. Once this is complete, select "create repository." Keep this page open, as you will need to refer back for the clone URL.
Within the command line interface, you'll want to navigate to the desired folder for saving the clone. Next, type in the command "git clone" followed by the clone URL copied from the Github repository.

#Describe what open source means.#
Open source references to software where the original code is available for free distribution and modication. Open source code can be changed and redistributed as well. Since we are working in "public" environments in the Github community, our code is open source. Github thrives from the open source community, as developers freely share code with one another.


#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?#
The concept of developers sharing ideas is great, because that's the best way to learn. We share tricks with one another, and provide suggestions on direction. We can also rely on one another to problem solve and push the entire community forward. At my level, I don't find this invasive, but I could understand why certain companies choose to stay away from open source communities.

#Assess the importance of using licenses.#
Licenses can determine the extent to which an individual or group is comfortable sharing code within an open source community. You may choose a license that allows others to build off your code, or prefer to retain the rights to your work. The absence of a license tends to mean that default copyright laws apply. However, this may not be the desired affect one wishes to have within a community of developers sharing ideas and code. It is important to understand the need of a license and the different kinds available.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?#
Navigating through the command line interface seems to be more natural now. Also, checking git status and understanding what still needs to be committed went a lot smoother. My true "aha" moment was when I opened by github.io URL to see the webpage I had created. I've gone through sublime text and uploaded through a server before, but never used git. Having the dots connect was nice -- especially considering I struggled with the initial setup in the previous challenge.
I'm still experiencing issues with merging and am unsure whether I'm doing that correctly. Conceptualizing local vs. remote will come over time and practice.


#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.#
Explored a few topics in stack overflow to review previous lessons. I also went back and referred to previous reflections for help.
