      <h3>Get to Know Git</h3>
      <h4>My First Post</h4>
      <h5>10.4.15</h5>
      <h5>By: Zach Schatz</h5>
      <p>Hi there! As a DBC student, I'll be maintaining a blog to share my experience with everyone. This week, we're diving into git and managing fundamental components through CLI (command line interface) as well as Github. A week ago, I said to myself, "Sh*t, I don't know git," and maybe you're in the same boat... but fear not! Let's work through a few basic principles together and get to know git.</p>
      <p>Git is a software that people use to work together on projects. Git helps groups work together by utilizing version control. You can think of this process as a less user-friendly version of Google Docs. Git is accessed through a command line interface, which can be bare and unappealing to the casual computer user. The reason why many developers learn to use git is because of version control. Version control is the software's ability to track updates (known as commits) while someone is making changes to a file. A developer will commit these updates to mark checkpoints in progression. If for whatever reason the user wants to retrace her steps, version control can display previous commits and resume work at one of those committed points. You can think of this as a checkpoint in a video game, or continuously making a "save as" version of a Word document. Another benefit of version control is that not only can you monitor changes, but you can see the changes that others make to the same file. This facilitates seamless collaboration in group projects.</p>
      <p>Git helps keep track of all changes by encouraging good habits of clarity with commits. While learning git, mistakes are bound to be made. In my short experience, I've already reverted back to previous commits more times that I can count. After making a commit, it is advised to leave an editing comment as a reminder to yourself - and anyone looking at your work - what has been changed and why. These changes can be reviewed through the "git status" command, instantly reviewing times and comments of all changes.</p>
      <p>A final thought for this post: Don't let Github confuse you with git. Git is the software -- Github is a 3rd party web community that uses git to share projects with one another. Many developers (myself now included) run git on a local machine and push projects to Github for distribution. In fact, I wrote this blog post in a text file, which I uploaded to Github by using git. That being said, Github is a great resource to share code with other developers. It acts as a remote intermediary for projects to live. Github also a great place to find resources and code examples while learning from others.</p>

      <h3>My First Post</h3>
      <h4>And first blog, actually</h4>
      <h5>10.5.15</h5>
      <h5>By: Darius Atmar</h5>
      <p>I should start by saying hello. My name is Darius, and I recently joined DevBootcamp to become a web developer. I am one week into my learning, and will presently be making the world's quickest turnaround from student to teacher. First up: the benefits of version control. Version control as it relates to code is the process of tracking the evolution of a code over time as a series of snapshots in time. Think of a basic program: making a hash of names and corresponding heights, and then converting the heights from feet and inches to centimeters. Version control allows you to save a 'version' of your code after you have made the tediously large hash. Now, if you completely mess up the implementation of converting all of those heights from feet/inches to centimeters you don't have to worry because you have a version of your code just before you botched it! Furthermore, if you have a more complex problem, version control allows you to work on separate parts of your code in different versions, called branches, at the same time, without affecting each other. They can then be merged together to make one beautiful program.</p>
      <p>Git is the version control system that I am currently working with. It is a local system, meaning it saves versions solely within my hard drive. Git helps me keep track of changes with 'commits,' which are akin to save checkpoints in a video game. Every time you have made a change to your code, or added a file that you think is significant, you can add these changes to your branch and then commit it, which includes a description of your changes since the previous commit. This allows you to view all of your changes over time by viewing your commit log.</p>
      <p>So, what happens if you want to work on a coding project with someone else? This is where GitHub comes into the picture. GitHub is a remote version control system that can sync with, and can sync to your local git repositories. You can, for example, go to a colleague's repository on GitHub, 'pull' that code onto your local git system, make meaningful contributions, and then 'push' that code back onto GitHub. Now, if you did this responsibly, your colleague will be able to see a separate branch (or version) of the code on GitHub, and decide whether or not he wants to merge your contributions with his code. This functionality extends to extremely complex projects with potentially hundreds of developers contributing over its lifespan. In addition, there is also the added benefit of being able to access your code remotely from different computers.</p>
      <p>I am excited to take the leap into the world of development, and I'm pretty sure I will be coding less anxiously knowing I have version control as a safety net every step of the way.</p>
      <p>Thanks for tuning in,</p>

<!-- REFLECTION TO BE ADDED HERE:

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Some of the HTML5 tags we used: <!doctype html>, <header> and <article>. I find that all three of these are found in practically every webpage. The doctype tag is the HTML5 initializer, so that will be included with all HTML5 work. As for the header and article tags, these seem to be key organizers for writing HTML5 pages. Labels such as these allow for other developers and designers to collaborate being easier to decipher than divs, for example.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out in a hierarchy building as the code reads downwards. It's a system of nests. The browser will read the first prepare for a possible outcome - then dive into a given section and begin reading further to display the desired text/visual. Web pages load from top to bottom, reading the header followed middle sections and ending with the footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Snippets are awesome! They're definitely going to become incredibly useful as languages become more complex. I'll be on the lookout to find more shortcuts like that.
